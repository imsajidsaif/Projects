My name is sajid saifi,from Ghaziabad,utter pradesh,currently i'm working with TCS research and innovaation unit,
their i have worked for data science and machine learning  product development,in which we are working on different types of bussness problem test cases.
and we are trying to solve same problem with help of machine learning/AI and data science trending technologies. 
and ,Earlier i was worling as a data analyst intern in wipro.So i have totally 2+ year of experiance in data science and machine learning with 
 i have done so many certificcation,trainings in these feilds.
if if i'm talking about my college background so i  have completed my b.tech from lovely professional university punjab.
and my hobies is just travelling and listening musinc ya that's all my side.










Firtly i will tell you who gives us this project,and what are the objectives of this project.
Project name: Mergining stops
Projects is based on Postnord,sewdona and denmark,
the Objective​ of project is 
Postnord delivers huge number of parcels every day and pays its drivers based on number of stops that they take during delivery. 
A team manually merges these stops considering different scenarios to reduce cost of driver settlement.​

So,we are making  a product to assess the extent of automation possible for automating the stops merging process.​

Scope ​
To check  the extent of automation that is possible for merging of stops for daily packages delivered and potential accuracy​.
If i'm taking about language which Postnoed is using 
Language: English language and  special characters  from ISU-85991 database.​


if i'm taking about Scenarios to be Considered for Merging​:

1.Same Name + Same Address + Same Time + Different Stop = Merge​
2.Similar** Name + Same Address + Same Time + Different Stop = Merge​  (**Similar here means changes in case,
 occurrence of special characters, misspelled words or missing characters/numbers.​)
3. Different Name + Same Address  + Same Time + Different Stop = Merge​
4. Different Transport Task Number + Same Name + Same Address + Same Time + Different Stop = No Merge​

after that we are creating dataset to predict same types of stops by using machine learning algorithm.

Dataset:  transport id,name,address,city,zipcode,area_distance_from_origin_center,stops(target feature)

Technology : Python,NLP,Flask,machine learning algorithm,Postgreesql,Similarity Matching Algorithms(FuzzywuzzY),optimized automation using python.




2, project was mostly focused on document validation system.
Project name: Computer Validation System
Project is based on USA client(pharmesyy).
the main objective was to validate Document with proper Intructions ,firstly for testing purpose we verify the CSV product with original Document . ly 
in this project totally 10 cases are there,
1.first -2 test cases were basically based on OCR(Optical character recognition),in which are extract required information information from different type,
of files,like images filem pdfs,etc. with help of ocr,
2. next 3 test cases were based on automation part,in which we are verifying the timestamp,product names,taxes,total amount and descriptions
 part of document with orignal data.
3. 6 test cases was very crusial which was based on approval part,like we are cross check the status of the medical application ,it's approved,not approved
in process ,reject,like that.
4. 7th testcase was based on the machine learning task,in which try to
 predict weather no of steps mentioned in application is multiple or single,it's was binary calssification based problem.
5. 8th test cases was based on sentiment analysis part,in which we were extract the feedback part from  pdf application and try to predict weather
 this feedback text is positive,negative,neurtal etc.in this we had used python,OCR,NLP,and machine learning algorithm.
6.9th and 10th test cases are mostly depend on checking accuracy of each test cases and create dashbord in form of pie chart and bar chart.

ya that's all

Technology : Python,NLP,Flask,machine learning algorithm,SQLalchemy,optimized automation using python,OCR.
